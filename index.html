          With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that
          established them as truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture.
          Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated, and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames
          look".

          That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and includes the
          world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

        <p class="content">
          Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue
          us? Can we make it better? Will we have "serious fun" doing it? Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it
          better? Will we have "serious fun" doing it?

          They loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and

          A problem-solver who encouraged experimentation among his staff, Charles once said his dream was <q>to have people working on useless projects. These have the

          Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the developement of the Moulded Plywood Chairs,
          <q>Yes, it was a flash of inspiration</q>, he said, <q>a kind 
          of 30-year flash</q>.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          With these two, one thing always seemed to lead to another. Their revolutionary work in moulded plywood led to their breakthrough
          work in moulded fibreglass seating. A magazine contest led to their highly innovative "Case Study" house. Their
          love of photography led to film making, including a huge seven-screen presentation at the Moscow World's Fair in
          1959, in a dome designed by their friend and colleague, Buckminster Fuller.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Graphic design led to showroom design, toy collecting to toy inventing. And a wooden plank contraption for taking naps, rigged
          up by their friend, director Billy Wilder, led to their acclaimed chaise lounge design.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          A design critic once said that this extraordinary couple <q>just wanted to make the 
          world a better place</q>. That they did. They also made it a lot more interesting.
